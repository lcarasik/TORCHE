These models are simple to use pressure drop and Nusselt Number calculators based off the work of Zukauskas et al. and Gnielinski and Gaddis. 
It is intended that future versions will include additional crossflow models in tube bundles, across helical coils, and across packed bends. 

TORCHE is discussed in greater detail in the following conference proceedings:

## Pressure Drop Correlations and Models

There is currently only two crossflow pressure drop models implemented. These are models developed by Zukauskas-Ulinskas and Gnielinski-Gaddis where the former is based off curve fits from old figures while the latter is a generalized set of equations based on inline or staggered geometries.

### Zukauskas Model

Notes:
* These are only considered valid for the specific pitch to diameter ratios listed.
* The Reynolds number is based on the maximum velocity in the narrowest area between tubes.
Validity: (need to recheck ranges)
* Number of rows of tubes:
Nr >= 1
* Reynolds number:
10 ≤ Re ≤ 10e6
For in-line tube arrangement: 	a x b = 1.25 x 1.25;   1.5 x 1.5;   2.0 x 2.0. 
For staggered tube arrangement: a x b = 1.25 x ----;   1.5 x ----;  2.0 x ----.

### Gnielinski-Gaddis Model

Notes:
* Not limited to specific pitch-diameter ratios within limits after a high enough Reynolds numbers. 
* The Reynolds number is based on the maximum velocity in the narrowest area between tubes.
Validity:
* The available experimental measurements used to develop the above equations covered the following ranges: Reynolds number: 1 ≤ Re ≤ 3 /* 10E5 and number of tube rows: nR ≥  5.
* Number of rows of tubes:
Nr >= 5
* Reynolds number:
1 ≤ a ≤ 3*10e5
* In the range Re < 10E3: 
For in-line tube arrangement: 	a x b = 1.25 x 1.25;   1.5 x 1.5;   2.0 x 2.0. 
For staggered tube arrangement: a x b = 1.25 x 1.0825; 1.5 x 1.299; 1.768 x 0.884.
* In the range Re ≥ 10E3: 
For in-line tube arrangement: 	1.25 ≤ a ≤ 3.0; 1.2 ≤ b ≤ 3.0. 
For staggered tube arrangement: 1.25 ≤ a ≤ 3.0; 0.6 ≤ b ≤ 3.0; c ≥ 1.25.

## Heat Transfer Correlations and Models

There is currently only two crossflow heat transfer models implemented. These are models developed by Zukauskas-Ulinskas and Martin-Gnielinski where the former is based off curve fits from old figures while the latter is a generalized set of equations based on inline or staggered geometries.

### Zukauskas Model

NOTE:
* Currently only applicable for staggered geometry
* The Reynolds number is based on the maximum velocity in the narrowest area between tubes.
Validity: (need to recheck ranges)
* Number of rows of tubes:

* Reynolds number:
100 ≤ Re ≤ 3x10e5
For in-line tube arrangement: 	1.25 ≤ a ≤ 3.0; 1.2 ≤ b ≤ 3.0. 
For staggered tube arrangement: 1.008 ≤ a ≤ 2.0; 1.008 ≤ b ≤ 2.0
? 10 < Re < 2e6
? 0.7 < Pr < 500
